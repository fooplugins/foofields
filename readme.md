# FooFields

A demo plugin showcasing what FooFields is capable of.

A "Movie" custom post type is created with a bunch of demo fields to showcase what is possible.

Activate FooFields, then navigate to FooFields -> Genres to add a few test movie genre taxonomy terms. Do the same for Movie actors. Then goto FooFields -> Add Movie to create a new Movie using FooFields.
